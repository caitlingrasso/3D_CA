3D Cellular Automata


Signaling "rules":

Each cell has a voltage and a refractory period
Each signal has a randomly chosen propagation length
When a cell becomes activated, a signal begins

Start the pacemaker with a random number between -- and -- and decrement until it reaches zero (this is the propagation length)
When it reaches one, the signal has died (baseline is 1 because of visualization issues)
